- 👋 Hi, I’m @Shawn-Ellard
- 👀 I’m interested in coding, networks and Linux
- 🌱 I’m currently learning coding (Python and JavaScript), network architecture and protocols and Linux (especially Pop!_OS 20.04 - 20.10)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Pop!_OS documentation aimed at users because the information is currently scattered and difficult for us mere mortals to find so we can fix our systems when something goes wrong or we foul them up.
- 📫 How to reach me email: kg6ejx912@gmail.com Discord: SCBE
